### Introduction
After doing Wes Bos's [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com) I wanted to combine what I had learned in the Text Shadow Mouse Move video (Day 16), with a flashlight effect I learned from Online Tutorials youtube video [Power Of Light v0.2](http://youtu.be/SHRcgP_IZHI). I added a click event listener to simulate an actual flashlight. I just wanted to see if it would work like I pictured it in my head, I didn't wind up using it on a project. If I were to rework it I would add color and varying saturation. I also uploaded a version that's all one file, some might find it more readable?
